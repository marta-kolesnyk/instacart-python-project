# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Overview:
This project was focused on Instacart - an online grocery store that operates through an app. The company already had good sales, but they asked to uncover more information about their sales patterns and provide criteria for customers segmentation.

## Data Used:
1. “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, 
Accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle.
It includes a list of products, departments, and amount of items sold.
2. Customers dataset - fabricated for learning purposes and includes customer age, gender, marital status, and city of living.

## What went well?
Deriving new variables was beneficial, as it helped to make such a large dataset easier to analyze by assigning labels to the records and building visualizations based on the new variables.

## Challenges
Learning how to build the appropriate charts was challenging for me. Also, taking into consideration the size of the dataset, it was time-consuming to make a single graph, as this required more computing power from my computer.

## Project Deliverables:
- Excel report
- Jupyter Notebook Scripts
